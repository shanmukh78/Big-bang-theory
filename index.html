        <h2>0 seconds — Singularity</h2>
        <p>At the very beginning of the universe, there was no space or time as we understand it. Everything—energy, matter, and space itself—was compressed into an infinitely small, dense point known as a singularity. This singularity contained all the mass and energy of the universe in an extremely hot and dense state. There was no "before" the Big Bang, as time itself began with the Big Bang.</p>

        <h2>10⁻³⁶ seconds — Cosmic Inflation</h2>
        <p>Just after the Big Bang, the universe underwent a process called cosmic inflation. During this period, the universe expanded at an extraordinary rate—much faster than the speed of light. In just a fraction of a second, the universe grew by a factor of more than 10^26 times. This rapid expansion smoothed out irregularities in the early universe and laid the foundation for the formation of galaxies and stars.</p>

        <h2>10⁻³³ seconds — Quark Soup</h2>
        <p>As the universe continued to cool, the energy in the early universe began to condense into particles. At around 10⁻³³ seconds, the universe was filled with a hot, dense mixture of quarks and gluons. This state is often referred to as "quark soup." The quarks would eventually combine to form protons and neutrons, the building blocks of matter.</p>

        <h2>380,000 years — Formation of Atoms</h2>
        <p>After about 380,000 years, the universe had cooled enough for electrons to combine with protons and neutrons to form the first simple atoms, primarily hydrogen and helium. This process is known as **recombination**. With the formation of neutral atoms, light could finally travel freely through space, creating the first **cosmic background radiation** that we can still detect today.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>100 million years — First Stars</h2>
        <p>After hundreds of millions of years, small fluctuations in the density of matter began to grow. These fluctuations eventually led to the collapse of gas clouds, forming the very first stars. This period is known as the **cosmic dawn**, and it marked the beginning of the formation of galaxies. These first stars were massive and short-lived, shining brightly before collapsing into black holes or exploding in supernovae.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>500 million years — Formation of Galaxies</h2>
        <p>During this phase, the first galaxies began to form as gas clouds collapsed under gravity. These galaxies began to cluster together, forming the larger structures we observe today. The universe was still a chaotic and young place, but it marked the beginning of the universe’s architecture that would eventually lead to the galaxies and clusters of galaxies we observe today.</p>

        <h2>9 billion years — Solar System Formation</h2>
        <p>Our Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago, but the universe was already around 9 billion years old at the time. This was the point at which gas and dust in the Milky Way galaxy began to collapse, forming the Sun and the planets. Earth’s formation came later, eventually leading to the conditions necessary for life as we know it.</p>

        <p>Life on Earth began roughly 3.5 billion years ago. The first living organisms were simple, single-celled organisms that evolved in the primordial soup of early Earth. Over time, these organisms became more complex, setting the stage for the evolutionary process that would eventually give rise to the vast diversity of life on Earth.</p>

        <p>As the universe continued to evolve, galaxies formed, stars exploded, and planets came together.
